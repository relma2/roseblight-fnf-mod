# Vs Blite Week Structure rough ideas
## Stage Structure:
Refer to (Aplove Tweet)[https://twitter.com/AploveStudio/status/1370435954280960004]
Assets in layer order:
Sky/Mountain Background (Light)
Top Bop: Red glow; positioned on side of mountain
Layer: Trees + Broken window flower shop (Centered)
Bottom Bop: Side RB characters - Arial, Crismaj, Zyra? Gf is fourth; but looks annoyed (see song 1)
Two to four backup barbles

### GrayEvil:
Red glow; simps; barbles gone
CHAINS EVERYWHERE

## Brain Jail
This week on BF looking for random ppl to rap battle...

Nite wants his girl on the speakers for once; chain noises; screen cuts to black; and q is on speakers with gf in background (on same layer as bg squad but shes cheering on bf)
"ah! much better"
"beep! beep! beep!!!!11!"
"if you want her back on her spot you're gonna have to earn it"

Missing combo results in Nite pointing and laughing at you
At tail end of song, vocals cut and Blite puts the straps back on

### Motifs
Black Keys; Trowel through the BACK; Lake of Regret
**Mood**: Nite being needlessly edgy for two minutes straight; "Battle me to get yo girl back on her throne :P"

## Himbo
Blayk introduces himself to Bf (again) and hes like "beep beep!" "i... told you my name? you must have the wrong guy"
"Gosh dang it what did i do this time" lol

### Motifs
Trowel through the Heart but swing tempo; Buckler 2 main theme but swing; some original motifs

**Mood**: kind of silly trying to de-escalate? Note: Himbo is SLOWER in tempo than Brain Jail

## Aplovecraft
(blite talking to themselves)
> "you wanna keep rapping this kid?"
> "pleeeeeaseee??"
> "fine, but im gonna be here to prevent you from going... *overboard*"
> "admit it, you think this is fun too"
> "..."
> (they remove one shoulder strap)
> "allright, you wanna dance?"
> (Max Pausadina chains activate; chains everywhere on the stage)
> "lets dance"

^ NOTE: Placeholder dialogue, not final im just trying to get a general structure\/feel i am bad at writing
^ NOTE 2: Friday Night Funkin is... effectively an excuse-plot game. As long as the songs slap and the charts are fun, the "plot" can be cliche as fuck and people will still lap it up. It just needs to be coherent

Voice boops have chain noises

Pausa notes: Miss them and u get frozen for 3 seconds and watch helplessly as you miss more notes 

### Motifs:
Beyond My Understanding but key-shifted to sound more spOOkY; Blindsight theme but only a little bit; general "you are dead dead dead" third-song vibes
**Mood**: *"Th-th-that's... not... an ahokan..."*
