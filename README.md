# Friday Blight Funkin' : Roseblight mod

## Friday Night Funkin'
**Friday Night Funkin'** is a rhythm game originally made for Ludum Dare 47 "Stuck In a Loop". This **mod** is a crossover with [Roseblight](https://aplovestudio.itch.io/roseblight) ; a story driven game in development about a gardener investigating a crash-landed alien and repairing the bond with his alter ego.
