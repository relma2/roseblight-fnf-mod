{{Nametag|Nite}}: Well... MY girlfriend wanted that front-row seat, so I was happy to punt yours off of it!

{{Nametag|Nite}}: You comfy up there, Qrystal?

{{Nametag|Qrystal}}: mhm yeah sure

{{Nametag|BF}}: beep boop!

{{Nametag|Nite}}: Name's Blite. Saw you having a sing fest outside my flower shop so I figured I'd join in

{{Nametag|BF}}: beep bop skedoop!

{{Nametag|Nite}}: 'Put Girlfriend back up there...?' Well if you want Qrystal's SEATWARMER back on that bass-boosting throne...

{{Nametag|Nite}}: Fight me for it.

{{Nametag|Nite}}: And when I WIN I think I'll take that shiny palette shard hanging from your mic!

====Himbo Dialogue====
{{Nametag|Blayk}}: Um... hi, my name's Blite; I kind of... own this shop so I'd like to ask that you please keep it down?

{{Nametag|Blayk}}: Your speakers are being kind of... loud

{{Nametag|BF}}: beep!

{{Nametag|Blayk}}: What do you MEAN I already told you my name-

{{Nametag|Blayk}}: ...you are so grounded.

{{Nametag|BF}}: beep! beep!

{{Nametag|Blayk}}: Wh-what rap battle?

{{Nametag|BF}}: bop boop!

{{Nametag|Blayk}}: Can I... forfeit or something?

====Aplovecraft Dialogue====
{{Nametag|Blayk}}: OH COME ON!! I JUST had that window fixed! You-you're gonna pay for that, right?

{{Nametag|BF}}: beep!

{{Nametag|Blayk}}: You can't just solve all your problems with a rap battle, you know.

{{Nametag|BliteTransform}}: ...

{{Nametag|BliteTransform}}: ...What? No, Nite, he's just a kid. I can talk things out.

{{Nametag|BliteTransform}}: ...Can I at least scare him a little bit?

{{Nametag|BliteTransform}}: ...Fine, but I'll be with you so you DON'T. Go overboard.

{{Nametag|BliteTransform}}: Admit it, Blayk, you think this is fun too

{{Nametag|BliteTransform}}: ...

{{Nametag|BliteTransform}}: ...don't push your luck

''(They take off one shoulder strap and chains fill the stage)''

{{Nametag|Blite}}: Allright, you wanna dance?

{{Nametag|Blite}}: LET'S DANCE.

====Post-Aplovecraft Dialogue====
Narrator: If you liked this mod and want to see more, check out Roseblight by AploveStudio
<br />It's a masterpiece in development about a gardener who investigates the strange glow you saw 
<br />on that mountain in the background while repairing the relationship with their other half.
<br />It's a story of pent-up repressed rage, reconcilliation,invasion by alien colours, and the chains binding them all.
<br />You can download the Roseblight demo on Itch io, and the full game is estimated to release by the end of 2021.
<br />And be sure to support the developer's other games set in the same universe!<br />With Love, Relma
