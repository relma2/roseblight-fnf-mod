# The creator of Roseblight is Not a Good Person.

I didn't want to have to write this.

My name is Relma. I'm a fan of a small indie game in development called Roseblight; and I'm writing this to expose how its creator has horribly mistreated myself and his other fans and does not deserve the admiration he's getting for his creation.
I was banned from the Roseblight Discord over a collection of minor issues I had with the creator, Alex Loverde ([Aplove Studio](https://aplovestudio.itch.io/roseblight)). Because my grievances were small, I offered to talk it out with him like adults, but instead he chose to abuse his authority and cut me off from a support network that had kept mine and others' mental health up for the past year. He continued his cowardice even after the banning, and honestly I've had enough of him as a person.

## The Masterpiece

Roseblight is... an incredibly well written story in RPG form. I became invested in it after playing the first chapter, and over the course of the past year I was a QA tester, publicist, marketer, wiki editor, literary analyst, community manager, community lynchpin, and prolific fanartist. I did all of this for free out of sheer fan passion, because to me this story was destined to be taught in Literature classes decades after the author's death.

Specifically, I
 - Compiled a list of over 60 streamers whom I personally emailed about the game to cover it
 - Began outlining a crowdfunding campaign
 - Spent money commisioning art for this mod and [others](https://www.kiwibyrd.com/) to advertise
 - Created a Trello Board to keep track of reported bugs
 - Datamined the code using `UndertaleModTool` to find potential errors and secrets
 - Created and maintained the game's [Fandom Wiki](https://roseblight.fandom.com)
 - Created a long-form animation meme with [The Colour Out of Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc-oODaZ11U).
[Footnote: These efforts were collaborations with other fans, but the point is I did a lot.]

As a result, we formed a tight-knit community of about 100 people all as passionate about the game as he was. But after releasing a major update, he started having issues with his community.

## The Problems

It all started when I posted a link to Momocon, a convention that had an indie game award showcase with actual prize money. I thought he had a good shot at winning, and that would be good for getting his game out there.
Because it was located in the same *state* as him, he saw it as "revealing where he lived" (despite putting what college he goes to in his profile) and threatened to ban me for "doxxing" them. This made me feel upset and afraid because I did not do what he had accused me of and he was threatening me into silence when he had a position of authority over me.

But it wasn't the first time he had threatened to ban people over imagined crimes. He also mistreated another community member known as Shardi Seal in the same way. In an earlier draft of his game, he made a character asexual, but decided against that in a later draft. (This is totally fine; people introduce and discard ideas in rough drafts all the time.) But being ace herself, Shardi was upset that Loverde made this change, and made her displeasure known both publicly and personally. Instead of defending his writing decisions and refuting her like an adult, he threatened to ban her if she brought that up again. He used his position as community leader to threaten people into silence for ultimately minor criticism.

To another member named SuperEclipse, he also mentioned wanting to release Chapter 2 by Chapter 1's one-year anniversary. It's good to set deadlines for yourself, but having datamined the code and knowing him closely as a developer, this felt like an arbitrary and rushed deadline. He was feeling defeated, and it felt like he wanted to get it over with and finish it as quickly as possible. We were understandably concerned for the game's quality over this self-imposed "Crunch".

I was also the game's most vocal critic, largely identifying where certain game mechanics didn't work and analyzing the writing at a far deeper level than most fans would. Although my tone was sharp sometimes, he is unable to refute negative criticism, or even just ignore it. He had repeatedly messaged me when he perceived I was "overly negative" because it only identified what didn't work.
He was paranoid that my tone would become "associated" with the community and him; and told me as such. People are intelligent enough to distinguish us, and critique where it was due does not make a fandom more toxic by any stretch. He was merely paranoid about him and his fandom being associated with me instead of him.

Lastly he started getting more emotionally distant. He used participate in Voice Chat with the community and have fun with us personally, but now was refusing to participate in it beyond superficial interaction after his major update.
When I invited him to a movie night, he said we "were not his friends" because we were "just fans", despite the fact that he had been fostering this community on a personal level. He was paranoid that all friendships with fans were parasoicial in nature, and hurt us personally as a result.

I knew I couldn't let these issues fester any longer, so I approached him and said "we need to talk".
SuperEclipse offered to mediate.
But Loverde had a quicker solution -- it was the ban button.
```
I went ahead and banned her from the discord last night for disrespectful behavior. I don't want to drag this issue out any more either, so I'm putting an end to it immediately. I understand you guys want to help me out and get a better understanding of the situation by explaining both sides, but I'm not going to negotiate anything out of issues like these. Please don't push this any further.
```
She left the Discord in protest.

What hurt the most was I checked his Discord profile after banning me, and he *hopped on GameMaker* like nothing happened, and continued working. He was telling everyone, including himself, that I was somehow the biggest obstacle to Roseblight's success. It hurt because I wanted to be there to help that happen, and he threw me away despite all my efforts.

## The Coward

People started to ask where I was. Many of my friends quickly noticed that I dissapeared from the server for no reason, and checked in on me. I saw screenshots of people making plans in the server to check in on me, and when I told them what Alex did, they started asking *him* where I went.

He was silent. He said *nothing* in his own server for a week; not even to offer a twisted manipulative explanation of how "toxic" I was. He was too much of a coward to defend his own actions.

A week later, he deleted his own discord. He cites the strain of managing a community on his mental health, but in my opinion, that is a LIE. He tried to get rid of me quietly and ran when he realized that wouldn't happen; he didn't have the balls to tell anyone what he did.

(The Roseblight fandom formed an Unofficial Fan Server the day this happened, largely so we could still hang out and stay together.)

A month later, we had a conversation about all of this that quickly turned sour. He told me he banned me because he "cared about me" and me having a huge attachment to the game he was making. Upon talking about QA testing, I mentioned we could have been his QA testers, but somehow he considers fans doing such work a failure and started making it about him and how his fans hated him for realeasing something with bugs. <br>
I wasn't having any of his gaslighting, so I told him te *real* reason we hated him -- the emotional distance, the cowardice, and the ban threats for imagined transgressions. That he kept running away from people instead of trying to better his relationships. He replied:
```
everything i've done is for the sake of what i believe needs to be done, and i'm not going to let anyone drag me down
i know people hate me and i've accepted that, that's the price one has to pay for popularity
and i'm not going to try to redeem myself because i have to look to the future, not dwell in the past
```
There will always exist people that have issues with you, and who you have issues with. But if you respond to every issue by cutting them off and """moving on""", then you consider your relationships *disposable*. And that says a lot about you as a person.

A few months later, he spoke with [Spudcats](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZC4SDAKluEi_Abo2z0q_Q), a pair of Lets Player YouTubers who we are both friends with. When it came to the subject of reforming the discord and... *me*, he straight up admitted what I've known for a while:
```
i've been considering making another discord after the game is complete, and if i do i'm going to make some strict rules that prevent behaviors like this and probably look into getting some mods that i trust. if i could invite everyone in the fan server except for them to it i would, but i feel like some people are friends with them and probably will continue to defend them and will create a lot of unnecessary drama and i don't want to deal with that
```
He basically admitted "I would continue isolating and mistreating this person if they didn't have friends who would stand up for them". I was... disgusted. My friends were disgusted. That his base impulse, his go-to "solution", is to throw people away, and the one thing stopping him is others *knowing* when he does.

Just... thoroughly a loathsome coward.

## The Love

Even after all of this... I'm still invested in this game. The story of Blite still needs to happen, and it's still destined to become one of the most brilliantly-written games of the century. That's why I've created this Friday Night Funkin' mod, so the game can get the attention it deserves. And so Alex can get attention by proxy, which makes him crumble like the pathetic coward he is.

But Alex Loverde is not a good person. He is a coward who would rather abuse his authority, ban people, and sweep problems under the rug rather engaging with personal issues like an adult. One part of being a public creator, game or otherwise, is knowing how to grow and maintain the fandom you have. He has no interest in fostering or supporting the community he created and attracted to him, and he's clearly seen axing and cutting off people as the best way to focus on his game at the expense of real people's emotional well being.

And Loverde: if you're reading this... For writing a story about how two people are forced to repair their relationship through concessions instead of repressing them all the time, you lack a lot of self-awareness. Everyone in the unofficial server knows exactly what kind of person you are, and you've just run into the one person who isn't having any of your shit.

If this is how you treat your most dedicated fans, *you don't deserve Roseblight's success*.
