:dad-empty: If you liked this mod and want to see more,\ncheck out Roseblight by AploveStudio
:dad-empty: It's a story-driven game in development about a gardener who\ninvestigates the strange glow you saw on that mountain in the background\nwhile repairing the relationship with their other half.
:dad-empty: It's a story of pent-up repressed rage, reconcilliation,\ninvasion by alien colours, and the chains binding them all.
:dad-empty: You can download the Roseblight demo on Itch Io, and the\nfull game is estimated to release by the end of this year.
:dad-empty: and be sure to support the developer's other\ngames set in the same universe!
