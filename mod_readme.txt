APLOVECRAFT:
This song features a mechanic with notes that freeze you and the chart if you miss them for a specified amount of beats, forcing you to watch helplessly  as you miss more notes. If you are on HARD, you must hit these notes at "Good" or "Sick" or you will still get frozen. I have deliberately made myself unable to clear it on hard. Good luck.
Tips? If you are frozen, mash every step to avoid getting locked out. It technically releases you one step before, so this can help you escape. Prioritize hitting the warns over normal notes if you have to choose. Also, you can view the song on BotPlay to memorize the chart before playing it

Known issues:
Replay does not register Pausa notes correctly, leading to you "dying" on a replay file even if you cleared it.
